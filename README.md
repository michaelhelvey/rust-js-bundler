# YAB

Yet Another Bundler. A useless boil-the-ocean project, just for fun :)

## Getting Started

At the time of writing, the only completed component is a (mostly spec compliant?) lexer. You can
bench mark it on a reasonably large JS file (react-dom.development.js) by running `just bench`.

As for other commands, you can do all the usual cargo things. See `justfile`.
